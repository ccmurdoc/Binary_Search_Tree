# Binary_Search_Tree
Creates a random tree of nodes, the nodes contain two integers, A and B.  Input N from the keyboard, this is the number of nodes to be generated, loads them into a binary search tree based on the value A.   Displays the tree.  Then, searches through the nodes and computes the SUM of all the B values and displays the sum.

This project was created using Codeblocks with the GNU GCC compiler in version C++ 11. In order to run this program, please clone or download this repository. Then, go to Binary_Search_Tree/bin/Debug/ pathway and click the executable file named Example1.exe .

A prompt should appear asking for the number of desired nodes. Please input the desired amount. Aferwards, the application will compute and display results.
